# Mac headset

I had the same problem and drove me crazy, but in my case the solution was quite simple: the problem were the headset. I was using Android ones that are incompatible (at least in part) with Apple device, and my Mac muted itself randomly.

Headset compability with Mac OS.

| nope | most Android headphones | TRRS plug         | 4-pin headset connector | Audio Left > Audio Right > Ground > Microphone |
| ok   | Apple headphones        | Apple TRRS plug   | 4-pin headset connector | Audio Left > Audio Right > Microphone > Ground |
| ok   | stereo (no-mic)         | standard TRS plug | 3-pin headset connector | Audio Left > Audio Right > Ground              |

Note: Android vs Apple headphones: Ground / Mic headset connector are inverted.
